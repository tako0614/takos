# Push Notification Configuration
# There are three methods available (in order of priority):

# Method 1: Direct FCM Integration (Recommended for production)
# Set FCM_SERVER_KEY as a secret:
#   npx wrangler secret put FCM_SERVER_KEY
# This sends push notifications directly to Firebase Cloud Messaging.

# Method 2: Custom Push Gateway
# Set these secrets to use your own push gateway:
#   npx wrangler secret put PUSH_GATEWAY_URL
#   npx wrangler secret put PUSH_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# This delegates push notification delivery to your custom gateway service.

# Method 3: Default Push Service (Fallback)
# If neither FCM nor custom gateway is configured, the default service will be used.
# You can customize the default service URL and secret:
#   DEFAULT_PUSH_SERVICE_URL = "https://your-push-service.com/events"
# And set the secret:
#   npx wrangler secret put DEFAULT_PUSH_SERVICE_SECRET

# Optional: Customize notification title
#   npx wrangler secret put PUSH_NOTIFICATION_TITLE
